    # This is added to prevent Visual Studio from creating an empty packages folder.
    # It's usually safe to ignore the packages folder itself.
    # But if you're using PackageReference in .csproj, this might not be needed.
    # However, it's generally good practice to let NuGet restore packages rather than committing them.
    # It also helps avoid conflicts when multiple developers work on the same project.
